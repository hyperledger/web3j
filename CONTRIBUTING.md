## How to contribute to web3j

Thank you for reading this! If you'd like to report a bug or join in the buidl-ing of web3j, then here are some notes on how to do that.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/web3j/web3j/issues). If there is then please add any more information that you have, or give it a :+1:. This will help us prioritize work.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/web3j/web3j/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or event better an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Make sure that the code is formatted with Spotless by executing `./gradlew spotlessApply` otherwise the build will fail.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change [Discord**](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1195062053682032700) then start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use web3j should be directed to the [discord channel**](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1195062053682032700)

### Note
** If you are unable to open the Web3j discord channel then first join the [Hyperledger Server](https://discord.gg/hyperledger) and then go the [#web3-general](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1195062053682032700)
